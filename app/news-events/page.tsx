Dr. Sachin Nagarkar with more than 30 years of experience on guiding physical and sexual needs of special persons and sexuality conducted a session for parents of the differently abled persons. This programme was organized on 28th September by Saptrishi Foundation in collaboration with Sobati Divyang Group, Nirvan Divyang organization and Abhisar Foundation and it took place in Divyang Bhavan, Pimpari.

This programme was attended by parents of the special persons, representatives of social organizations and persons working in this field. The programme started with preface by Jyoti Agharkar of Sobati Divyang Group. Dr. Sachin Nagarkar guided the participants through discussion, dialogue and brainstorming. He told that sexuality is natural and innate. He told how humans have evolved from animals and how humans are separate from them due to qualities such as compassion, empathy and sensitivity. Intellectually disabled or differently abled persons also have sexual emotions and sexuality. They are intellectually disabled, but they too have the same emotion. Appropriate expressions and release of this sexuality is necessary. When this does not happen, such children and adults become angry or more upset. It is the stress caused by blocking of natural needs and emotions. We should understand their sexuality and help them to release it appropriately, he added.

Dr. Nagarkar sir shared valuable insights and gave a new perspective on handling these sensitive matters with care and understanding. He suggested ways such as cultivating certain habits in the children since their childhood, training them to express themselves in socially acceptable and appropriate ways, good company of opposite-sex friends and use of sexual toys when appropriate. He emphasized that giving only instructions indicate rejection of that person and instead of this, if we appreciate small things, then we convey acceptance and it helps for further progress.

He also discussed issues such as how to satisfy the sexual needs, should they marry or not, responsibility and complications lying therein. He told that these things are decided on the basis of each case and situation with possible support system and helping hands. Parents responded this lively and light-mood discussion by Dr. Nagarkar with plenty of questions and appreciation.

Although there are constraints and limitations regarding sexuality of the differently abled persons, ways can be found out. Energy of the children and the adults can be channelized to other areas, they can be imparted skills, they can be encouraged to mingle with the people and have friendships and they can also be made self reliant, added Jyoti Agharkar of Sobati Divyang Group. Secretary of Saptrishi Foundation Manoj Borse talked about work done by Saptrishi Foundation and their 'one stop solution.' Vote of thanks was delivered by Vrushali Borase.

Many parents expressed that Dr. Nagarkar sir shared valuable insights and gave a new perspective. They also expressed their desire to participate in further such activities by Sobati Group and Saptrishi Foundation.`
