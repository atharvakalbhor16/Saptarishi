                  It is a nice App prepared by Saptrishi Foundation, We get all updates regarding Niramaya Health Insurance Scheme and other services and information in this app. It saves our time and money. Every year since 2016 till 2024, we have received reimbursement of OPD expenses incurred for my Son – Abhijit. With Saptrishi Foundation's assistance, we are able to get some reimbursement for our medicine costs. It makes a big difference. We are really thankful to Saptrishi Foundation.

                  My son is having 90% Intellectual disability. It is very hard to move from one place to another. Due to this, we have faced many difficulties in work related to Documents such as UDID card. It was possible due to Saptrishi Foundation that YCM Hospital team had come for home visit for UDID related work. Saptrishi Foundation had taken continuous follow up with the Hospital from the visit for physical examination till UDID card was generated and given to us. Also I received medical expenses reimbursement and financial aid from the Government with the help and guidance of Saptrishi Foundation. My Sincere thanks to Manoj sir and his team.
